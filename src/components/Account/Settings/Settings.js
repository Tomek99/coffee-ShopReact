          Due to this option, you can log out from our website and application
          on all browsers and devices at once - also the account that you are
          using right now.

        <h2>Deleting account</h2>
        <p>
          If you click on this button, you will delete your account in our
          store. Make sure you definitely want to do this - your account cannot
          be restored.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to keep your account, but don't want to get messages from
          us - uncheck the consents in the notification settings.
        </p>
        <button>Delete account</button>
